Optical Character Recognition Based on 40-Point Feature Extraction Using Matlab

Handwriting recognition has been one of the most fascinating and challenging research areas in field of image processing 
and pattern recognition in the recent years. It contributes immensely to the advancement of an automation process and can 
improve the interface between man and machine in numerous applications. Several research works have been focusing on new 
techniques and methods that would reduce the processing time while providing higher recognition accuracy. In general, 
handwriting recognition is classified into two types as off-line and on-line handwriting recognition methods. 
In the off-line recognition, the writing is usually captured optically by a scanner and the completed writing is available as an image. 
But, in the on-line system the two dimensional coordinates of successive points are represented as a function of time. 
And the orders of strokes made by the writer are also available. The on-line methods have been shown to be superior to their off-line 
counterparts in recognizing handwritten characters due to the temporal information available with the former.
However, in the off-line systems, the neural networks have been successfully used to yield comparably high recognition accuracy levels .
Several applications including mail sorting, bank processing, document reading and postal address recognition require off-line 
handwriting recognition systems.

As a result, the off-line handwriting recognition continues to be an active area for research towards exploring the newer 
techniques that would improve recognition accuracy. In our project we have taken 30 characters for each of English alphabet character 
starting from A to Z and 10 characters for each of English alphabets for testing of Neural Network to have the accuracy which will 
make us understand how much accurate we are to make the Artificial Neural Network to recognize each of the English alphabets 
character perfectly.
